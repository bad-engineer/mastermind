**In the Single Player game, the Mastercode is locked and you have to guess it. After every attempt, you'll get the number of correct colors you chose, and the number of balls with the correct color and place. You have to use these clues for your next guess.**

**In the Two-Player game, each user sets a code which is then locked at the top, and the one to solve faster wins!**
